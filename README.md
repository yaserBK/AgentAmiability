This code was written to conduct experiments for an MSc first year research project. \
The code models a rudimentary leaderboard/reputation system to encourage collaborative play in multi-agent systems. \
\
It uses a simple Reinforcement Learning Algorithm akin to Q-Learning and includes a single NFG - The Prisoners Dilemma. \
Experiments can be configured to run via the following file: src/main/java/Main.java \

Game settings (i.e. payoffs, selection methods, etc) can be changed via the following file: src/main/java/models/Game.java \
\
The outputted results are stored as CSV's for the sake of quick plotting and analysis using Excel.

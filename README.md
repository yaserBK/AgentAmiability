This code was written to conduct experiments for an MSc first year research project. 
\n
The code models a rudimentary leaderboard/reputation system to encourage collaborative play in multi-agent systems. 
It uses a simple Reinforcement Learning Algorithm akin to Q-Learning and includes a single NFG - The Prisoners Dilemma. 

The code can be configured to run via the following file: src/main/java/models/Game.java

A slightly more flexbile code-base for the analysis of Multi-agent RL can be found here: 

The outputted results are stored as CSV's for the sake of quick plotting and analysis using Excel.
